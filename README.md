#### Challenge 6: Module 6

# Overview of the Project

Challenge 6 focuses on working on some updates for the PlanMyTrip app, created during Module 6. One of the modifications for the app is adding a weather description for the weather data already obtained. To identify some travel destinations and hotels, input statements are required to filter the data so users can select their weather preferences. Also, the user should be able to choose four cities from the destinations given for a travel itinerary and a travel route between the chosen cities with a marker layer map with Google Maps Directions API.
